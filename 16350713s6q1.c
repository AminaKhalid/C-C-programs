/*Write a C Program which prompts the user for employee records and then writes each
record to a file called students.txt. The user should be prompted to enter each studentâ€™s
first name, surname, student number, phone number, field of study, and GPA. Be careful to
provide code to allow a user to indicate they have stopped inputting data and to check for
invalid data. The result should be a text file with several student details*/
